    My name is Ethan Richards, I am a new graduate from the Software engineering technology program at Conestoga College's Waterloo campus.  I first discovered my passion for software engineering when I was briefly studying economics at the University of Guelph.  My roommates were studying CS. They would often talk about the assignment they were currently coding or the concept they were just taught.  I found myself vastly more interested in what they were talking about than my own studies.  I guess you could say my supply of focus for economics could not meet the demand needed to become the next Warren Buffet.

    After 3 short semesters at the University of Guelph, I left. However, I didn't leave empty handed, I had some idea of what I wanted and knew what I didn't. Around a year later, I was sitting in my first C/C++ class at Conestoga's new Waterloo campus.  It was great, I constantly wondered how all kinds of software worked and if I could make it with what I already knew.  I began having dreams about assignments I was working on and my YouTube recommendations filled with computer science related videos.  I was and still am immersed.

    I am into more than just software.  Name a sport and I've probably played it. I started my life kicking and hitting socker and tennis balls, then I traded my cleats for skates.  I was a fanatic for hockey.  My best friend and I would wake up before school to play for a couple hours then run home after school to play until it was too dark to see the ball.  My interest shifted when I discovered I had some talent for triple jump and the 200m dash.  This was around the time of the 2008 olympics in Bejing.  Usain bolt taking home the gold medal while celebrating before the finish line was all I needed to see to become hooked. Shortly after that, I entered highschool and found my love for football.  I started as a tight end but became the quarterback after a practice where my coach asked if anyone in the huddle could throw the ball for a trick play.  Football consumed me for the next few years and naturally lifting weights came with this which I loved equally.  My playing days came to an end after I ruptured my achilles tendon in a summer league game. Now a days, I play basketball with a group of friends two or three times a week in the summer.  I think we all got inspired by the raptors championship run as we've been doing it since Kawhi led them to the title.
