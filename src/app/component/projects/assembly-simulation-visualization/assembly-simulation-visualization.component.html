            <p>Over the course of this project, my knowledge of relational databases was strengthed as I dove deep into SQL Server utilizing stored procedures, functions, triggers and a job.  On top of this, I discovered the power of object relational mapping by using the .NET Entity Framework and LINQ to stream line SQL Server queries. I also learned a lot about making UI as I had to update various UI elements from outside the UI thread and dynamically position user controls in my assembly line visualization program.</p>

            <h2>Simulation console application</h2>
            <p>I created a C# console application to simulate a single worker/workstation.  The number of instances of the program that can be run is equal to the number of workstations the simulation is currently configured to allow, this number can be increased or decreased using the configuration app. If a workstation is available, the current instance of the program will update the database to reflect the newly unavailable workstation then it will launch the workstation visualization application so the user has a real time visual representation of what the instances' worker is doing.
            <br>
            <br>
            The program takes an argument to determine the skill level of the worker that is about to be simulated.  The skill level of the worker will determine the amount of time each fog lamp takes to create and the chance it's defective.  The fog lamp completion time scales in real time to the time mode the simulation is set to. The time mode can be updated from the config app to various modes; real time, default mode (1 minute real time = 1 second sim time), and super speed mode (1 minute real time = 100ms). 
            <br>
            <br>
            A worker in the simulation is given a configurable amount of 6 different parts.  A single one of each part is used to create a fog lamp.  When a fog lamp is completed, it is added to a testing tray represented by a table in the database. When a worker's remaining number of any part is equal to 5, the worker places a card in a tray notifying the "runner" that they are in need of a specified part restock.  The simulation has a single runner for all instances of the simulation program.  As such, the runner may be busy restocking other workers parts allowing for cases where a worker will not have enough parts to continue working.  In this case, the worker waits until the runner restocks their parts. The runner is represented by a SQL Server job allowing instances of the sim program to be on different machines.  The worker will work until the program is stopped by closing the data visualization app that was launched at the time the sim started or until the sim itself is stopped by closing the terminal.
