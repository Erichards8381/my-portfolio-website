It looked like a far better developer experience so I made the website you're currently reading this on with Angular. I have enjoyed using it far more than using Angular JS.  Getting to use the CLI and having typescript available has felt like a more modern experience with less headaches.  I also prefer the Angular file structure. As a new user, it's easier to get up and running and keep everything organized."
